## EVQ Assignment 3
# Data Profiling & Cleaning (using openclean & pyspark)


## About the Dataset

The dataset that we are assigned to profile and clean is [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). This dataset contains 27.1 million rows and 41 columns, where each row is a 311 service request. It should also be noted that this dataset is automatically updated daily.

For profiling and cleaning, we randomly sampled ~5 million rows from the entire dataset. The compressed file containing the samples that we used is made available via our Github repo: [PLACE NAME WITH LINK] (599.5MB). 

The full dataset is available for download via the [Socrata Open Data API (SODA)](https://dev.socrata.com/). Note that OpenClean includes a SODA wrapper that provides access to all datasets available via the API using their unique identifier. The compressed full dataset is about 2.74GB in size.
